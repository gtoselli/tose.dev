I'm a software developer with 8+ years of experience in building product startups. My development philosophy is heavily influenced by **Domain-Driven Design** principles, which emphasize the importance of modeling software around the language and concepts of the business domain.

In addition to DDD, I'm also a practitioner of **Agile** and **Extreme Programming** practices, such as:

- test-driven development
- continuous integration
- pair programming

I believe in delivering high-quality software through iterative, collaborative, and feedback-driven development processes.

I'm particularly interested in using **CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Segregation)** and **Event Sourcing** patterns to build scalable, event-driven systems. These patterns allow for flexible, decoupled architectures that can evolve over time to meet changing business requirements.

Outside of work, I'm also a **Scout leader**, where I help guide young people to become responsible and engaged members of their communities. This role has taught me the importance of leadership, mentorship, and teamwork, which I bring to my work as a developer.
