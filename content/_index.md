# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is <span class="text-highlight">Tose</span>.
But on paper, youâ€™ll find me as <strong>Toselli Gabriele</strong>.

I'm a software developer with 8+ years of experience in building product startups.
My development philosophy is shaped by **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, focusing on modeling software around the language and concepts of the business domain.

I'm particularly passionate about **CQRS** and **Event Sourcing**, building scalable, event-driven systems that can evolve with changing business needs.
